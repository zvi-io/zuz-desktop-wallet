    | provided by Netmint Intermediação de Serviços e Negócios LTDA (“we” or “us”).  {{native_currency_name}} Desktop Wallet is a version of the open source
    | {{native_currency_name}} software client that allows users to access the decentralized {{native_currency_name}} transaction protocol
    | payment network ("{{native_currency_name}} Protocol").  Source code for {{native_currency_name}} Desktop Wallet and related software is available
    | free of charge under open source software license agreements at <a href="https://github.com/rippex">https://github.com/rippex</a>  We hope
    | you find {{native_currency_name}} Desktop Wallet to be useful as a tool to access and use the {{native_currency_name}} Protocol.
  p Please read this End User License Agreement <strong>EULA</strong> carefully as it explains your and
    | our respective rights and responsibilities associated with your access to, and use of, {{native_currency_name}} Desktop Wallet.
  p 1. <strong>{{native_currency_name}} PROTOCOL</strong>. You understand that {{native_currency_name}} Desktop Wallet allows you to interact directly
    | with the {{native_currency_name}} Protocol to create a {{native_currency_name}} Protocol account (“{{native_currency_name}} Account”), initiate payments
    | postings to the {{native_currency_name}} Protocol as well as view transaction histories and balances available via the
    | {{native_currency_name}} Protocol.  You understand that {{native_currency_name}} Desktop Wallet itself does not process payments, or hold
    | transaction histories and balances and is merely a tool for initiating actions that occur within the
    | {{native_currency_name}} Protocol and viewing the record of those actions.  You understand that actual payments are
    | processed via the {{native_currency_name}} Protocol, not {{native_currency_name}} Desktop Wallet, and that resulting balances shown in {{native_currency_name}}
    | Trade are (i) actually held by third parties or (ii) in the case of translateCoin('XRP'), held through a chain of
    | custody documented on the {{native_currency_name}} Protocol public ledger (“The Ledger”).  You acknowledge and agree
    | that we have no control, responsibility or authority over such third parties.  {{native_currency_name}} Desktop Wallet merely
    | interoperates with such entities via the {{native_currency_name}} Protocol.  For more information about the {{native_currency_name}}
    | Protocol, including {{native_currency_name}} Protocol transaction fees, please visit the <a href="https://{{native_currency_name}}.com/build/">{{native_currency_name}} Developer Center</a>.
    | You further acknowledge and agree that transactions you initiate within the {{native_currency_name}} Protocol will be available to
    | the public on the Internet via The Ledger. {{native_currency_name}} Desktop Wallet allows you to view the public payments data
    | posted for {{native_currency_name}} Accounts – including your own {{native_currency_name}} Account.  Once data is shared to the {{native_currency_name}}
    | Protocol, neither {{native_currency_name}} Desktop Wallet nor any third party may selectively censor or blacklist access to, and
    | subsequent use of, such data.
  p 2. <strong>THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</strong>. You may be able to access and use third-party content and
    | services displayed via {{native_currency_name}} Desktop Wallet, such as gateway services (“Third-Party Services”), including
    | Third-Party Services that interact directly with the {{native_currency_name}} Protocol.  When using any Third-Party
    | Services, you are interacting directly with such services, not us, and you agree to comply with any
    | terms and conditions applicable to such services.  {{native_currency_name}} Desktop Wallet may display or otherwise highlight
    | certain Third-Party Services for your convenience, but we do not endorse any Third-Party Services.
    | You are solely responsible for your use of any Third-Party Services.  We are not a party to, make no
    | representations or warranties as to, and have no responsibility or liability with respect to any of
    | your communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and
    | any third party providing the Third-Party Services, including any fees that may be charged to you in
    | connection with your use of any Third-Party Services.
  p 3. <strong>{{native_currency_name}} ACCOUNT DATA</strong>. Your {{native_currency_name}} Account, including any private and confidential data
    | accessible therein, is protected from unauthorized access and use by others via a secret key and
    | password held by you and not {{native_currency_name}} Desktop Wallet.  {{native_currency_name}} Desktop Wallet cannot assist you in recovering your secret
    | key and password.  It is your sole responsibility to keep your secret key and password protected from
    | unauthorized discovery.  {{native_currency_name}} Desktop Wallet is not responsible for the consequences of another party
    | accessing and using your {{native_currency_name}} Account data because it is your sole responsibility to keep you secret
    | key and password from being accessed and used by unauthorized third parties.
  p 4. <strong>BLOCKING</strong>. You understand and agree that we may block excessive or abusive use of
    | {{native_currency_name}} Desktop Wallet download links from a particular IP address at any point in time and for any length of time, in our
