    | 1. 
    strong THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK PROTOCOL. 
    | The THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK Products facilitate access to and interaction with the decentralized THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK transaction protocol payment network (“THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK Protocol”). The THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK 
    | Products may permit you to access a THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK Protocol wallet (“THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK Wallet”), initiate payments postings to the THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK Protocol, and view transaction 
    | histories and balances available via the THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK Protocol. You understand that THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK Products are merely a tool for initiating actions that occur within the 
    | THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK Protocol and viewing the record of those actions. You understand that any balances shown in THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK Products are (i) actually held by third parties or (ii)
    |  in the case of {{translateCoin('XRP')}}, held through a chain of custody documented on the THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK Protocol public ledger (the “Ledger”). You acknowledge and agree that THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK
    | has no control, responsibility or authority over such third parties. THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK Products merely interoperate with such entities via the THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK Protocol. For more 
    | information about the THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK Protocol, including THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK Protocol transaction Fees, please visit the THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK Wiki (https://THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK.com/wiki/). You further 
    | acknowledge and agree that transactions you initiate within the THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK Protocol may be available to the public on the Internet via the Ledger. Once data is 
    | shared publicly via the THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK Protocol, neither THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK nor any third party may selectively censor or blacklist access to, and subsequent use of, such data. 
  p
    | 2. 
    strong OTHER AGREEMENTS. 
    | The terms of this Agreement shall not apply to the extent (a) a specific THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK Product has been provided to you under a separate written agreement with 
    | THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK – in such case the terms of such separate agreement shall prevail with respect to the use of such THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK Product; or (b) a specific THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK Product is 
    | open source software – in such case the terms of the applicable open source software license shall prevail with respect to use of such THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK Product and in 
    | no event shall THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK’s liability, if any, with respect to any aspect of open source software exceed any limitation set forth in Section16. Except as 
    | provided in the foregoing, this Agreement contains the parties’ entire agreement, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings between the 
    | parties regarding THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK Products.

    | gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state.
  p 
    | 16. 
    strong LIMITATION ON LIABILITY. 
    ol(type="a")
      li You acknowledge and agree that THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK: (i) does not have any authority or responsibility to prohibit, restrict, rescind or approve any transaction or

      | DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS (E.G. OF PROFIT, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL). Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental

      | loss, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) or damages incurred by such entities in connection with third party claims that any of the 
      | THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK Products infringe or misappropriate a patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property right of such third party. The

      | to assume the sole defense through its own counsel of any matter for which it acknowledges its indemnification obligations hereunder and to compromise or 
      | settle any such suits, provided that any compromise or settlement that imposes liability on an indemnified entity shall be subject to such entity’s

    strong DISPUTES. 
    | PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK

    | California law regardless of your location or any conflict or choice of law principle.  Any Claim filed later than 1 year after the facts giving rise to

    | to arbitrate any Claim in which either party seeks equitable or other relief for the alleged unlawful use of its intellectual property. ARBITRATION PREVENTS 
    | YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL. You and THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK agree that you will notify each other of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it 
    | arises, that you will attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration, that any arbitration will occur in San Francisco, California, USA and 
    | that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal 
    | arbitration law apply to this Agreement. You and THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK also agree that the state or federal courts in San Francisco County, California have exclusive 
    | jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration. You and THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK each waive any 
    | objection based on lack of personal jurisdiction, place of residence, improper venue or forum non conveniens in any such action.  Neither you nor THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK 
    | will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any Claims related to this Agreement. 
  p 
    | 20.

    | party shall be entitled to assign this Agreement in its entirety to an affiliate, acquirer or successor entity as a result of a restructuring, merger or 
    | sale of all or a substantial part of its business or assets.  Any purported assignment made in violation of this Section 20 will be deemed to be, and will 
    | be, void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will bind each party and its permitted successors and assigns.
  p 
    | 21. 
    strong U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS. 
    | The THE {{native_currency}} NETWORK Products are Commercial Computer Software and Commercial Computer Software Documentation provided with RESTRICTED RIGHTS and are licensed to

  p 
    | 22. 
    strong OTHER TERMS. 
    | This Agreement will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of association, for tax purposes or otherwise, 
    | between the parties, and the parties will at all times be and remain independent contractors. Our failure or delay in exercising any right, power or 
    | privilege under this Agreement will not operate as a waiver thereof. If any provision of this Agreement (including the prohibition against class actions and 
    | other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained in Section 19) is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions 
    | will continue in full force without being impaired or invalidated in any way. The parties agree that any invalid provision shall be deemed to be restated so 
    | as to be enforceable to the maximum extent permissible under law consistent with the original intent and economic terms of the invalid provision.
